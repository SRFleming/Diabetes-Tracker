  <h2>General Information</h2><br />
  <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called
    blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and
    comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps
    glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p><br />
  <p>Diabetes requires daily self care and if complications develop, diabetes
    can have a significant impact on quality of life and can reduce life
    expectancy. While there is currently no cure for diabetes, you can live an
    enjoyable life by learning about the condition and effectively managing it.
    Diabetes affects over 1.8 million Australians. This is why it is important
    to provide as much support to those affected, and make daily self care as
    easy and fun as possible.</p>
