      <h2>General Information</h2><br>
      <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar,
        is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, 
        a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p><br>
      <p>Diabetes requires daily self care and if complications develop, diabetes can have a significant impact
        on quality of life and can reduce life expectancy. While there is currently no cure for diabetes, 
        you can live an enjoyable life by learning about the condition and effectively managing it. 
        Diabetes affects over 1.8 million Australians. This is why it is important to provide as much support to 
        those affected, and make daily self care as easy and fun as possible.</p>
